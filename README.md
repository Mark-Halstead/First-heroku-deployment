# Second-heroku deployment

A simple todo list!

## Description

I can use it to create my own to do list on a web app. This was the first time I was exposed to EJS and EJS templates. I found the notation a little difficult at first but managed to create my first project successfully! More time will need to be invested into creating projects with EJS templates to help get to better grips with it.
